## Tracker Story Title
Appends the story name to the project header when a story is maximized.

The story name is already present in the context of the story and in the page title but when the story is scrolled, the story name is scrolled out of view immediately while the page title was removed completely from all the modern browsers in order to minimize the browsers UI footprint. Thus there is no way to know what story you are browsing if the story was scrolled, which is a problem if you review many stories during the day.
